"""Fail a pull request that removes a public definition from ``beval/`` without
naming that definition in the PR description.

``beval`` is both a library and a CLI, so a public definition that disappears
breaks somebody's import as well as this repository's own tests. The scope rule in
``CONTRIBUTING.md`` asks for the same thing in prose; this check is the copy that
cannot be skipped by not reading it.

Usage:

    PR_BODY="<pull request description>" python scripts/scope_guard.py <base-sha> <head-sha>

Exit code 0 when every removed public name is mentioned in ``PR_BODY``, 1 otherwise.
A name counts as public when it is defined at module level and does not start
with an underscore.
